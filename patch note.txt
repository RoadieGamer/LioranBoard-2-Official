2022.3.0 Community Edition (June 17th 2022)

New Features:
✨ Delete key works in text boxes [Roadie]
✨ Added option to select a secondary Twitch Client ID [Silverlink] - this is an optional setting for now, but will be required in the future, which will require you to relink Twitch accounts and re-duplicate channel points made with LioranBoard
✨ Transmitter updated to V6. You can keep using V5 if you do not use the new secondary Twitch Client ID [Christina]
✨ Added the option to reveal Transmitter in File Explorer [Christina]
